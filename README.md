# apacseng_2024_design_10_year_anniversary

we notcied someone is using the design and we are now announcing that the designs are original works and are pretected by copyright laws. Pls check LICENSE file.

This repo contains the AIGC generated design for workshop 2024, our 10 years anniversary.

Why am I using external Git instead of Tesla within Confluence or internal service? 
It's because I need to use 3rd party AIGC tools/models and Discord/Photoshop and send the pictures to a vendor for printing out. Tesla secure related staff/logos are NOT included. Additionally, I want people to be able to review the pictures from anywhere, even if they cannot log in to Tesla SSO one day. So if you happen to be an infosec person seeing this, please don't judge.

## Raw pics

Raw pictures are the very raw design we got from AIGC and our group votes to use.
